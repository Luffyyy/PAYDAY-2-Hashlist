# Hashlist Mod (extract_paths)

Make sure to edit the path for your extract. You need to bind a key to run the paths finder; it can take a while (15–20 min), so you can edit the script to do more specific things.

Afterwards, you can filter the list using another bound key. You need to play a file named 'hashlist' (preferably the final hashlist) and it will remove any duplicates.
