# PAYDAY-2-Hashlist

Based on [Frankelstner's hashlist](https://bitbucket.org/Frankelstner/pd2-hashlist/overview) with [many additions](https://github.com/Luffyyy/PAYDAY-2-Hashlist/graphs/contributors)—a combination of scanning, bruteforcing, and manual guessing.

# Hashlist Mod (extract_paths)

Make sure to edit the path for your extract. You need to bind a key to run the paths finder; it can take a while (15–20 min), so you can edit the script to do more specific things.

Afterwards, you can filter the list using another bound key. You need to play a file named 'hashlist' (preferably the final hashlist) and it will remove any duplicates.
